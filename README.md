# Polaris Focus™

**Polaris Focus™** is an attentional tool developed by **Kaamos Labs LLC**.  
Guided by neuroscience and the philosophy of time, it helps people restore presence, clarity, and calm — not by measuring time, but by reimagining our relationship with it.

## Overview

Polaris Focus™ translates research on focus, flow, and time perception into a minimal, ambient experience.  
It’s built on the principles of **Attentional Design** — a framework developed by Kaamos Labs that rethinks how technology interacts with the human mind.  

Where most tools chase productivity, Polaris Focus™ cultivates awareness.  
It offers quiet structure instead of constant alerts, helping users stay aligned with their intentions rather than their interruptions.
