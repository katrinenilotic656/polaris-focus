## Core Capabilities

Polaris Focus™ reimagines focus through attentional design – reducing urgency, protecting attention, and supporting deep work without pressure.

## How It Works

### 1. Set Your Session

Select a session size that fits your focus rhythm:
- **XS** – Focus Burst
- **S** – Dynamic Focus
- **M** – Sustained Focus
- **L** – Creative Flow
- **XL** – Deep Work
- **Mega** – Immersive Focus

Each session has an approximate time window with slight variation, so no two sessions feel exactly the same. This keeps your focus anchored without turning time into a race.

### 2. Enter Flow

The visual chronoscape creates an environment shaped to support flow and keep distractions at bay. An asteroid represents your session and gradually dissolves as you focus.

### 3. Sustain Presence

Remain present without the burden of countdowns or the push of a ticking clock. Watch the asteroid dissolve into calm presence instead of racing against time.

## Core Features

### Symbolic Sessions

Session scales adapt to your rhythm. Each unfolds naturally without rigid countdowns, eliminating time anxiety while maintaining structure.

### Visual Chronoscape

A gentle progress view that eases urgency. The dissolving asteroid creates a sense of forward movement without pressure, allowing you to enter and maintain flow states.

### No Metrics, No Streaks

Focus is a practice, not a performance. Polaris removes streaks, scores, and tracking so you can work without pressure. There are no leaderboards, no achievements – just presence.

### ADHD & Neurodivergence Friendly

Created with different minds in mind:
- Flexible pacing without rigid constraints
- Minimal distraction and cognitive load
- Visual anchors that reduce time anxiety
- Design that supports varied focus patterns

### Offline Operation

Polaris works completely offline. No setup, no accounts, no interruptions. Simply open the app, select a session, and begin.

### Gentle Completion

When your asteroid dissolves, the screen glows softly to signal completion. There are no alarms or jolts – just a quiet ending that respects your state of focus.

## Use Cases

### Creative Deep Work

Protect long stretches of concentration for writing, design, coding, or problem-solving. Create in uninterrupted flow without timer anxiety.

### Research or Study Blocks

Engage deeply with complex material. Learn without the stress of measuring minutes or racing against deadlines.

### Journaling or Reflection

Hold space for clarity and thought. Reflect and process without rushing or pressure.

### Reset After Meetings

Step back into focus with intention. Transition smoothly between tasks and restore attention without timer stress.

## Who It Helps

### Creators and Writers

Give your ideas the time and space they need. Enter flow and create without distraction or urgency.

### Knowledge Workers and Professionals

Sustain focus across projects, meetings, and shifting priorities. Find clarity in complex work without pressure from the clock.

### Students and Lifelong Learners

Engage deeply with your studies or self-directed learning. Retain more by studying with presence rather than timer-driven stress.

### Researchers and Problem-Solvers

Think clearly and explore complexity with calm attention. Create space for breakthroughs without interruption.

## Design Philosophy

Most focus apps optimize productivity through timers, streaks, or gamification. Polaris removes pressure and creates an environment of presence, not performance. It is designed as a quiet companion for attention.
